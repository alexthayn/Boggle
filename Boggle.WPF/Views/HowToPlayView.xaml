                    The Boggle game consists of 16 6-sided dice, each side containing a letter. 
                    The dice are shuffled and arranged onto a 4x4 grid where players are given 3 
                    minutes to find as many words as possible by stringing together adjacent letters 
                    from the top face of each die. Words may be 3 letters or longer and a die cannot 
                    be used more than once in the formation of a word. Scoring is based on the length
                    of the word.

                    <LineBreak/>
                    The scoring is as follows:
                    <LineBreak/>
                        Fewer than 3 Letters: no score <LineBreak/>
                        - 3 Letters: 1 point<LineBreak/>
                        - 4 Letters: 1 point<LineBreak/>
                        - 5 Letters: 2 points<LineBreak/>
                        - 6 Letters: 3 points<LineBreak/>
                        - 7 Letters: 4 points<LineBreak/>
                        - 8 or More Letters: 11 points
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Whilst looking for as many words as possible is a good strategy, it is worth bearing 
                    in mind that longer words score more highly, so one 5-letter word is worth two 4-letter words.

                    <LineBreak/>
                    Note: Although the 'Qu' cube occupies a single space in the grid, it counts as two letters for 
                    the purpose of scoring. Full credit is awarded for both the singular and plural forms of a noun 
                    provided you list them as separate words, so cat and cats each score a point. The same is true 
                    for all other derived forms (e.g. chew, chews, chewed, etc.).
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    If a word appears more than once in the grid, it may not be counted twice. Also, multiple meanings 
                    of the same word do not earn multiple credit.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Any dictionary word is allowed. As in most word games, you will not receive credit for proper names, 
                    abbreviations, contractions, hyphenated words, or foreign words that are not in an English dictionary. 
                    You will be penalised 1 point for each guess you make that is not recognised as a valid word.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Words within other words are permissible. This can be a valuable fact to remember, for if you spot the 
                    word part, you can also write down par and art. In this case, it is also a word in reverse: trap.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    You will not be penalised for submitting the same word twice, but doing so will not increase your score. 
                    This may be helpful if you do not remember if you have already found a particular word; it is probably 
                    faster to type it again than to check your list.

                    A good knowledge of anagrams will help. If you notice the letters S, T, O, and P arranged in a 2x2 square, 
                    you will be able to write not only stop but also opts, tops, spot, post, and pots, scoring a total of 6 points.
